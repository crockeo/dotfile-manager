THE FOLLOWING IS THE SPECIFICATION OF PACKAGE FILE FOR THE dotfile-manager.

The file should be valid JSON (not just Javascript, but JSON). Values surrounded
by '<>' are used to indicate what the value should store. The file's name should
be stored in the root directory of the folder and called 'dotfile-pkg.json'.

One of these JSON files should contain a list of objects. Each object can either
have a type "file", "script", or a type "package". If it has a type "file" it is
in reference to moving a file to another place. If it's a "script", it runs a
script from a given location. If it's a "package", it installs another package.

File form:

[
  // A single file to be installed.
  {
    "type": "file",
    "src": "<path relative to package directory>",
    "dst": "<path relative to the user's home directory>"
  },

  // Running a script.
  {
    "type": "script",
    "src": "<path relative to package directory>"
  },

  // Installing another package.
  {
    "type": "package",
    "src": "<github repo name>"
  }
]
